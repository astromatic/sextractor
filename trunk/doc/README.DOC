The present documentation of SExtractor2 is still very incomplete: this
is rather a ``proto-documentation''. Chapters are missing. The english
is so-so. At least I tried to remove any obsolete information from V1.0.
I will progressively upgrade the documentation during the coming months.
In the meanwhile, you may still retrieve some basic information from the
old documentation included in V1.0 archive:
ftp://ftp/pub/from_users/bertin/sextractor/sex_1.0a.tar.gz
The SExtractor handbook from Benne Holwerda is also included for convenience.
