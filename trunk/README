SExtractor stands for ``Source Extractor'': a software for making
catalog of sources from astronomical images.
Multi-Extension FITS is now supported. Binary output catalogs are also MEFs.
ASCII output catalogs contain detections from all extensions merged together.
Use the "EXT_NUMBER" catalog parameter to identify the extension on which a
given source was detected. Check-images will also be written as MEFs if the
input image is a MEF.
- The (main) default config file can be dumped by typing "sex -d". Secondary
configuration files like default.param are still needed, though.
