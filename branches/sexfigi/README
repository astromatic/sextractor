SExtractor stands for ``Source Extractor'': a software for making
catalog of sources from astronomical images.
Multi-Extension FITS is now supported. Binary output catalogs are also MEFs.
ASCII output catalogs contain detections from all extensions merged together.
Use the "EXT_NUMBER" catalog parameter to identify the extension on which a
given source was detected. Check-images will also be written as MEFs if the
input image is a MEF.
- The (main) default config file can be dumped by typing "sex -d". Secondary
configuration files like default.param are still needed, though.

In case of problems, questions or suggestions related to the software,
please don't hesitate to send a mail (preferably in english) to the
official mailing list:
sextractor@iap.fr
These questions and answers to them are posted on the Web at:
http://terapix.iap.fr/soft/sextractor/
In any case you can still reach me at bertin@iap.fr. I cannot garantee
that I will reply immediately, but I will try for sure to provide
an answer.

Notes:
- A version "sextractor-2.3.1_lanl" of SExtractor is available on
SourceForge thanks to Mark Galassi and Dan Starr:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sextractor/
It is a reconditioned version of SExtractor 2.2.2. The LanL and the TERAPIX
(present one) versions follow two different development branches.
- Benne Holwerda <holwerda@stsci.edu> has written a SExtractor handbook and a
GUI which can be found in the doc/ subdirectory or at
