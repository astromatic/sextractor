Yet another rewriting of the XML part. Meta-data, error messages and catalog
info are now consistant between the catalog and the XML metadata file. Still
some pb with the COOSYS epoch and system in the VOTable version of the catalog
(but correct in the XML metadata file).
CATALOG_TYPE ASCII_VO changed to ASCII_VOTABLE.
Added a check in error catching to prevent recursive loops.
Added reinit of the warning counter to allow multiple uses of the warning
history.
Cleaned up configure.ac and added a default path for the (still missing) XSL
file.
Updated config/default.sex, BUGS HISTORY and README files.
Ready for release of V2.5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r286 | bertin | 2006-07-13 22:06:48 +0200 (Thu, 13 Jul 2006) | 5 lines

XML VOTable approach changed again: support for error messaging in VO catalog
(not only metadata) and FITS serialization of LDAC files in XML output.
COOSYS tag added with relevant information.
Removed MAMA_CORFLEX advanced config parameter (replaced with define).
Version number pushed to 2.5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added meta-data to VOTable catalog output.
Fixed potential bug with long command lines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r283 | bertin | 2006-07-11 23:04:18 +0200 (Tue, 11 Jul 2006) | 2 lines

Changed the way header WCS info is interpreted when EQUINOX is missing.

Pushed max number of recorded warnings to 100.
Changed XML meta-data output format to VOTable (not complete yet).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r278 | bertin | 2006-07-09 19:57:00 +0200 (Sun, 09 Jul 2006) | 4 lines

Added support for warning history in the fits library.
Added duration to XML error output.
Added ten most recent warnings to XML output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r277 | bertin | 2006-07-07 20:30:30 +0200 (Fri, 07 Jul 2006) | 4 lines

Added catching of error messages and forwarding to XML.
Added ASCII_VO output catalog format (inspired by G.Tissier's VOTable patch)
Fixed issue with conflicting CDi_j/CDELTi parameters (report by J.F. Bonnarel).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

r268 | bertin | 2006-06-29 22:38:02 +0200 (Thu, 29 Jun 2006) | 7 lines

Self Organizing Map code revived!
The FITS body writing routine now complies with strict aliasing constraints,
but:
Strict-aliasing optimization option dropped in acx_prog_cc_optim.m4 because of
too many problems with gcc 4.1 (missing X_IMAGE output, etc.): too much "fun"
with pointers in the SExtractor code.
Local background estimates work again after many years of oblivion, thanks to
an increased top margin in the buffering mechanism (bug found by P.Astier).
Overwriting of displayed infos fixed.

still missed.
